# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Please define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

**Version control keeps track of all changes made to the file. It is useful because it protects the source code if a mistake was made. This allows developers to go back and fix the mistake.**

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

**A branch is a copy of a project, which allows developers to work on a specified feature of the project until it is ready to be merged to the master branch. Branching is useful for working on different features of a project independently without affecting the master until it is ready for merging.**

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

**Commits are save points in Git. A good commit message should detail what has changed from the last commit.**

* What is a merge conflict?

**During an attempt to merge, a merge conflict occurs when the two branches have conflicting changes to the same lines in the code.**
