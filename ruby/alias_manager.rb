# PSEUDOCODE

# Create a method that:
  # takes in a name (string) and turn into two elements (first and last) inside an array, and then swap the order.
  # split name (new first and last name) into an array of individual letters.
  # pass each letter through a loop to change letter to next vowel or consonant accordingly

# Create a next_vowel method that takes a vowel and returns the next vowel character

# Create a method that takes a consonant and returns the next consonate character. # consonants = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz"
