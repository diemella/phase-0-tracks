The Plan

1. find resources
2. choose top 2 or 3
3. divise a study outline in order to determine when test knowledge
4. set aside 2 hours of study time
5. take notes during study
6. set up timer to take a 5-minute break after 25 mintues of studying until study time reach 2 hours

NOTES
- chose jon duckett and w3schools tutorial as study materials/resources-- was only able to cover w3schools within the 2 hour window
- abide by the podmoro method using a timer: can see the difference (doesn't fell as overwhelming)
- tested knowledge by reviewing what I learned in after the 5 minute break
- bookmarked references as I found them.
- What's worked?
  - finding the right resources (or combination of resources is important) is an important strategic move
  - taking a break
  - stoping to review
