You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

COMMAND:
SELECT * FROM users JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

OUTPUT:
1|Bradford|Pitt|1|5|Great service|1|1|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel
2|Mandy|Kaling|2|4|saved my car!|2|2|2|Amir's Towing
3|Angela|Jolie|3|1|too much howling|3|3|3|The Beagle Nightclub
1|Bradford|Pitt|4|3|slow service|2|1|2|Amir's Towing

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

COMMAND:
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM usereviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

OUTPUT:
Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|5|Great service
Mandy|Kaling|Amir's Towing|4|saved my car!
Angela|Jolie|The Beagle Nightclub|1|too much howling
Bradford|Pitt|Amir's Towing|3|slow service

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

COMMAND:
SELECT * FROM users JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id WHERE businesses.name = "Amir's Towing";

OUTPUT:
2|Mandy|Kaling|2|4|saved my car!|2|2|2|Amir's Towing
1|Bradford|Pitt|4|3|slow service|2|1|2|Amir's Towing
